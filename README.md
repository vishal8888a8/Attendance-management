# Student Attendance Management using ReactJS

As per requirement of the assignment below goals have been achieved

1. Data has been created using the useState() and no external dependencies was used.
2. Students are able to mark attendance using Roll Number and Student Name.
3. A checkbox to filter out the students who are currently present in the school today.
4. Check in and Check out time is strictly stored.


## List page

It shows the list of all students who have marked their attendance along with checkin time. If a student has not checked out yet, it will be shown by NA value of Checkout

## Edit page

A form page to take input from the student. One can either choose to mark entry ( checkin ) or mark exit ( checkout ). The time automatically saved by the app. A flash card is generated to showcase status of their entry after submitting the form.
Mechanism has been provided in place to avoid a student checkin/checkout twice, checking out before checkin etc.
